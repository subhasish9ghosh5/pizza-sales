## Project Description: 
In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about pizza sales from a pizza restaurant chain. The dataset includes details such as sales transactions, pizza types, customer information, and dates. My task is to analyze this dataset using SQL queries to gain insights into the sales performance, customer preferences, and trends over time.
